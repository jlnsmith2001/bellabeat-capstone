# Bellabeat Capstone
Google Data Analysis Capstone using R

## Business Task
Analyze the relationship between physical activity and weight trends to help Bella beat personalize fitness guidance and support wellness goals for users.

## Visualizations include: 
- Calories burned on days between users who logged and didn't log their weight
- Steps taken by users who log weight vs those who didn't
- Duration of intense physical activity between those who logged and didn't log their weight

## Presentation and findings
[Powerpoint](./https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MCfZBCSk3EIMnsgGrMGrtF-C6EHfO80BE4vOOS4lurk/edit?usp=sharing)

Based on my analysis, I recommend that Bellabeat tailor the user experience to encourage more consistent weight logging, as users who logged their weight were more physically active and more likely to meet their fitness goals. 

## Tools used
- R
- tidyverse, ggplot2
